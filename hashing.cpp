//      Hashing    (we use as a nickname)
//     most of the  time we have to play with the indices of the  indexes
//
//   for this we have two main option
//       traverse the whole array
//       or to store  on  the bases of modules  (element%10)
//
//
//       after this we faces two issue commmnly
//       which is known as collision
//
//       basically, by using the hash we concert the whole number into the small key called hash key

//     There are two methods to avoid collision
//    1) seperate chaining
//    2) open addressing


// seperate chaining :
//          In this we made the chaing with the help of the linked

// open addressing :
           // if collision occur then we can use probing by using the second argumnet
// Three types of probing :
// linear probing : if we have the linear function
//
// Quadratic probing : if we have a Quadratic function then we have to use quadratic probing
//
// Double hashing : where we can two hash function
